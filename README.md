# Math Question Topic Classifier

This project classifies high school math questions into topics like Algebra and Geometry using classical machine learning. It was built and run entirely in Google Colab.

## How to run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset zip file  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom  

## Approach
- TF-IDF for text feature extraction  
- Naive Bayes as a baseline  
- Linear SVM as the final model  
- Local LLM used to generate sample, student-friendly explanations  

## Dataset
The dataset is provided externally and is not included in this repository. Upload it manually to Colab before running the notebook.
